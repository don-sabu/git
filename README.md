# Exploring GIT and GitHub

Hey folks! This is my stash of GIT and GitHub learning stuff. The files in this repo might not be mind-blowing, but they were my go-to while figuring out GIT and GitHub ‚Äì you know, the learning struggle.

But hold up, I've got something cool for you. I've jotted down my GIT adventures on Notion. Check it out [here](https://donsabu.notion.site/37efe407525a4f868e485508d752fa2a?v=30cfb302f0fd4580beccb9777fd6158b&pvs=4). It might be your vibe too!

Shoutout to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/practical-git-and-git-workflows/#how-to-install-git-and-set-up-a-github-account), [GIT](https://git-scm.com/doc)'s official docs, and the "[GIT - Complete Course Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_euSNU_eLbegnt7aR8I1gXfLhKZbxnYX&si=cQ1KE1Xckdc5NZ-W)" playlist by "[Leela Web Dev](https://www.youtube.com/@LeelaWebDev)" on YouTube. Their wisdom made this learning journey way smoother.

Feel free to drop your suggestions or tweaks for the [Notion pages](https://www.notion.so/donsabu/37efe407525a4f868e485508d752fa2a?v=30cfb302f0fd4580beccb9777fd6158b&pvs=4). Let's vibe and level up our GIT and GitHub game together! üöÄ‚úåÔ∏è
